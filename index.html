<h1>Notes - Lesson 1</h1>
<p><b>The Basics of the web</b></p>
<p>The basics of the web are <b>html</b>(hyper text markup language - the programming language behind web pages)
<b>URLS</b>(URLS are web address that point to each page. <b>HTTP</b> ( hyper text transfer protocal is the protocal the entire web runs on) 
<b>Web applications</b>(complex programs on the web)</p>

<p><b>Major pieces of the web</b></p>
<b>You</b> (browser and computer)   The <b>internet,HTTP, servers.</b>
The computer uses a browser to send an http request to a server. The server responds over http with the HTML document requested.The browser on the computer reads the html and displays the webpage.

<p><b>HTML</b></p>
Hyper text markup language - created int he 90s - contains 30 billion pages.
  HTML markup  contains tags.   Tags consist of opening tags and closing tags. 
	THe whole markup containg the opening tag, the closing tag and the content of the tags is called an element. Some tags do not have a closing tag. These tags are called void tags. 
  An attribute is a property of an HTML element.  For example the href is an attribute of the a tag.

<p><b>Inline and block elements</b></p>
Block elements are surrounded by an invisible box that seperate them from other elements. Inline does not have the invisible box distinction.


<p><b>Computers are stupid</b></p>
Computers are very literal in what they understand. All punctuation must be correct pertaining to the language used.  A small mistake can cause big problems in a program.
